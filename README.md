Yes, yet another ORM for PHP. This meets my needs for an ORM with the following characteristics:

* Works well with legacy databases.
* Provides (requires) a Model class which helps coding in IDEs.

## How does this compare wth 'some other ORM'?

If you are starting a new project and have not yet defined your schema there are many other fine ORMs of varying complexity available for PHP. I recommend Red Bean.

If nothing else this section serves as a nod to other ORMs and their use cases.

| Name | Use Case |
| Red Bean | Great for new projects with a single database (although it can work with multiple) |
