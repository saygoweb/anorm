Yes, yet another ORM for PHP. This meets my needs for an ORM with the following characteristics:

* Works well with legacy databases.
* Provides (requires) a Model class which helps coding in IDEs.

## Features

* Provides a tool 'anorm' for quickly generating models from existing tables.
* Maps between camelCase property names and under_score field names common in database schema.
* Makes CRUD operations extremely simple.
* Doesn't get in the way of complex queries.

## Documentation

Documentation is available on the [docs site](https://saygoweb.github.io/anorm).
